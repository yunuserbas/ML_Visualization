# Machine Learning 

- Machine learning is a growing technology which enables computers to learn automatically from past data.
- Machine learning uses various algorithms for building mathematical models and making predictions using historical data or information.
- Learning techniques include Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning.

## Two Techniques
-	Linear Regression and Logistic Regression are the two famous Machine Learning Algorithms which come under supervised learning technique. 

### Linear Regression

1.	Linear regression is used to predict the continuous dependent variable using a given set of independent variables.
2.	Linear regression is used for solving Regression problems.
3.	In linear regression, we predict the value of continuous variables.
4.	In linear regression, we find the best fit line by which we can easily predict the output.
5.	Least square estimation method is used for estimation of accuracy.
6.	The output for Linear Regression must be a Continuous value such as price, age, etc.

### Logistic Regression

1.	Logistic regression is used to predict the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables. 
2.	Logistic regression is used for solving Classification problems.
3.	In logistic regression, we predict the values of categorical variables.
4.	In logistic regression, we find the S-curve by which we can classify the samples.
5.	Maximum likelihood estimation method is used for estimation of accuracy.
6.	The output of Logistic Regression must be a Categorical value such as 0 or 1, Yes or No, etc.
